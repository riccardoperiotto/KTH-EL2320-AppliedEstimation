# KTH EL2320 Applied Estimation
This repository contains the laboratory exercises from the course EL2320 Applied KTH Estimation, period II 2022. 
The course was taught by John Falkssson ([link](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/EL2320?l=en)) and mainly covers the following topics: Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman filters, Particle Filter, SLAM, Graph SLAM.

## Description
The repository contains 4 exercises:
- Lab 1: Kalman Filter;
- Lab 2: Particle Filter;
- Project: Graph SLAM;
- Final project: ApplePicker with Particle Filter.

The first 3 exercises follow the guidelines of the pdf files included in the corresponding folders and have been completed by changing the skeleton structures provided by the course. The two labs also include an initial theoretical part, assessed before the practical ones.

The final project aims to use the course content on a practical application and write a report contextualizing it with the existing literature.
